## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. This project aims to perform sentiment analysis classification using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and Transformers, leveraging the "Twitter-roBERTa-base" pre-trained model.

## Project Overview

Provide a brief overview of your project here, explaining its objectives, key features, and any unique aspects.

- **Objective**: The main goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis classifier that can accurately classify text into different sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Key Features**:
  - Utilizes NLTK for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
  - Uses the "Twitter-roBERTa-base" model from Transformers for sentiment classification.
  - Includes training, inference, and evaluation scripts.
